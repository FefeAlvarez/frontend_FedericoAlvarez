This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Semi-UI 
I used *Semi-UI* library to bring style to my app. A modern, comprehensive, flexible design system and UI library. Quickly build beautiful React apps. Learn how to use it, [here](https://semi.design/en-US/).
